    "Youre twice as likely to die from lightning than you are to win this game the first time playing it, so my assumption is that winners with less gameplay time that do win are either lucky, veterans playing on a new account, skilled at first person shooter gaming in genreal, or cheating\n",

    "Risks - \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest risk is that the data will not be available. There are many factors that go into gameplay and online gaming has been particularly susceptible to cheating as of late. Cheaters, especially if part of the training set, will dramatically reduce the reliability of the model. I will also need to get a lot of gameplay time from PUBG/Steam. This data may be onerous/difficult to readily obtain."
