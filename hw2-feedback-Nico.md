**Overall:** As per your last homework, a fantastic job! I know you are comfortable with this material so far, so I recommend that you focus in on writing efficient, pythonic code. Also, going into this next homework, I am sure that you will be able to make a clean logistic regression easily. So, you should try out some other modeling techniques, or data pre-processing too! For example, binning your variables as you stated, utilizing regularization, different model types, etc.!


**Some Notes**

* *Q.9:* Perfectly stated.
* Regarding your analysis plan, you should probably include what models/modeling techniques you think you should use. Considering we haven't gotten into it yet, this is more than okay to not include. However, typically when you write out your analysis plan, you include data cleaning, data manipulation, some analysis, and then modeling techniques to find, in this case, the relationship between Admission and Prestige!
* Remember when you pass the `inplace=True` parameter into methods, you are operating on and changing the object. Thus, you wouldn't need to return, and store, the object in another place. You could either just pass `inplace=True` or return and store the object!
