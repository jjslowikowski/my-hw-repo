***Project 1: Swimming***  
As I mentioned to you the first time we discussed this dataset, you may run into two problems:  
1) The data may be frustrating to scrape, though working through a pdf scraper might be a handy exercise.
2) You may not have enough data. Both in the sense that you might not have enough instances of races/people. And you might not have enough things to model on. If you think about what you can input, it might just be some indicators of who the person was, some information about the race, and pervious races. You ay not have a lot of that, likely necessary, data on each race (pool info, judge info, individual habits, practice info, etc. really any data that would indicate you would do well on a race).


***Project 2: BeatPort***  
A great project that would take advantage of some webscraping and some modeling! Definitely try your hand at grabbing the data first to see if you would like to continue.  


***Project 3: Player Unknown***  
I like this one! This one has lots of nice metrics and data that is already laid out for you to just grab. You just want to make sure that you have game-level information. Unless you want to predict total wins (what makes a good player). But, if you want to model, given these players in this game, what is the probability that *I* will win, then you need to build a model that will perform this task. As always, what is the question you want to answer *exactly*?  


*As I mentioned before, take a look at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) to find some fall back datasets. Any dataset is fine, as long as it is well-structured. If things become a bit too difficult, it's very important to have a fallback you can rely on!*
